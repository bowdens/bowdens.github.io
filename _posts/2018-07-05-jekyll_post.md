It's a bit of a pain to have to remember the date, put it in the right format, and then type out the front matter for each jekyll post.
So I made a super simple bash script called `jekyll-post` which will automatically create a file with the boring stuff sorted out - the file name and the front matter.
You can view it on github [here](http://github.com/bowdens/jekyll-post).
